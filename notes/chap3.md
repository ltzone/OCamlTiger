## Implementation

We use Menhir to generate the parser for Tiger Language. There are a few minor differences between Menhir and Yacc.
- Menhir does not generate a verbose transition table as Yacc does, instead `--explain` generates a `.conflicts` file which may be easier for users to understand and resolve the shift-reduce conflicts.
- The error recovery strategy in menhir does not support annotations like `%change`,`%values`,etc as described in the textbook. Instead, it creates a checkpoint for users to write a function to resolve errors
- [...](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec88)

However, the general syntax and principles are similar. With reference to the *Tiger Language Reference Manual* and [*Menhir Manual*](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html), we can implement the language.

To help you get started, [RealWorldOCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html) provides a chapter that introduces the workflow of writing a frontend in OCaml.

You should write the parser rules in the `.mly` file, and the `ml` code for parser will be generated by menhir. To configure the environment, make sure you have installed `opam 2.0+` and `ocaml 4.10.0+` in your system.

1. Install Menhir `opam install menhir`
2. Write your `.mly` rules
3. run `menhir parser.mly` to generate the code
4. You may also add switches like `--explain` to debug your parser
